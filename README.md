# TF-IDF score for query

## Introduction
This project will compute *TF-IDF* score of a document *D* with respect to an input query *Q* and a Doctonary of Entities(*DoE*)

## Input
**Document (D)** as a dictionary with *key*: doc_id and *value*: document_text
**Query (Q)** as a string of words
**Dictionary of Entities** as adictionary with *key*: entity and *value*: entity_id

## Output
The maximum TF-IDF score among all the query splits based on *Q* and *DoE*.
